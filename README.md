🛍️ Node.js Express EJS Store
A simple online store built with Node.js using Express and EJS for server-side rendering.

This is more of a template than a full-fledged application. This application can be used as a basis for creating your own application. The database is implemented through a local file, as is the image storage.

🚀 Features
